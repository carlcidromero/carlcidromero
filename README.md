# Carl (Cid) Romero

I'm a tech lead in fintech with two main responsibilities:

1. Design software solutions with UX, accessibility, and product teams.
2. Establish sustainable maintainability practices for engineering teams.

My typical day-to-day:

1. Driving discussion and refinement of solution designs.
2. Defining and sequencing units of work for timely delivery.
3. Contributing modular, focused, maintainable code to various codebases.
4. Balancing code maintainability practices with achieving business goals.
