# Hi, I’m Carl (Cid) Romero 👋

**Senior Software Engineer — Tech Lead, Bar-Raiser, Throughput Optimizer**

I help teams deliver **accessible, maintainable, high-quality software — faster.**  
I specialize in frontend architecture, test-driven development, and building systems that scale across organizations.

- Writing about **interview prep** and **real-world engineering challenges**.
- Studying **application security (Security+)** to deepen my ability to lead secure-by-design teams.

## 🛠️ Highlights

- **Co-founded** and maintain an inner-source **UI library** adopted by dozens of teams → reduced dev time and enforced consistent UX/accessibility standards.
- **Led** frontend architecture for an internal **microservices + microfrontend system (Spring Boot / React)** → enabled new 100% digital workflow for thousands of users with maintainable, testable code as the standard.
- **Championed** clean code and test-driven practices through content creation and **town hall tech talks** → raised quality standards and drove adoption of the UI library across the org.
